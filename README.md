# odin-recipes
My first Git project
This current project is a sample of writing a webpage in the text editor, and will have several recipes linked from the homepage. It is part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodineproject.com) Foundations Course. This project demonstrates my ability to write in basic HTML, maintain a Git project, and distribute it through GitHub.

Live project: [https://mandi628.github.io/odin-recipes](https://mandi628.github.io/odin-recipes)

Update: 2025.02.03

I have come a long way and learned a lot since I started this project. My current working place for our family's recipes with with a tiddlywiki at [Family Recipes](https://mandi628.github.io/family-recipes).

In the meantime, this project is an attempt at a self-constructed blog format recipe book. I will add progress in the [CHANGELOG.md] when applicable.
