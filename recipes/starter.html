    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These instructions will keep one cup of active starter on hand at all times. Most bread recipes call for 1 cup of starter, so you can double the starter instructions to have more on hand, or you can follow the suggested schedule below.</p>
    <p>There are starters you can buy. Some are cheap, some are expensive. But it's easy to start your own.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
    <div class="ingredients">
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>flour, your choice between all-purpose, bread, rye, etc.</li>
        <li>warm water, your choice between tap, spring, distilled, etc.</li>
    </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="steps">
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>DAY ONE: In a clean jar that will hold at least 24 oz., stir together 1/2 cup flour and 1/2 cup warm water. Stir it well. Cover the jar with a clean cloth and a rubberband, and wait 24 hours.</li>
        <li>DAY TWO: Place 1/2 cup of your starter in a new jar, and add 1/2 cup flour and 1/2 cup warm water. Tir it together well. Cover again and wait 24 hours. You can throw out the remaining starter from the first jar.</li>
        <li>DAY THREE: Repeat Step 2.</li>
        <li>DAY FOUR: You will repeat Step 2, but only wait 12 hours before the next feeding. By no, you should notice bubbling in the starter. Continue feeding it every 12 hours.</li>
        <li>DAY FIVE+: Continue repeating Step 2 every 12 hours. After about 10 days, the starter should be strong enough to raise bread. You also want it to be relatively thick - it should be the consistency of thick glue. If it's not thick enough, add a little extra flour at the next feeding. If it's too thick, add a little extra water.</li>
        <li>When the starter gets to this point, you should be able to feed it every 24 hours again to maintain it.</li>
        <li>Once you have enough activity, you can start using the discard for something like <a href="sourdough-pancakes.html">Sourdough Pancakes</a>, <a href="sourdough-crepes.html">Sourdough Crepes</a>, or <a href="sourdough-pizza.html">Sourdough Pizza Crust</a>. You can also measure off two portions of starter and setup two new jars. Keep one out to rise, and put the second one in the fridge. Be sure to feed the backup jar at least once a week (see below).</li>
        <li>You now have a starter ready to make <a href="sourdough-bread.html">Sourdough Bread</a>, <a href="sd-eng-muffins.html">Sourdough English Muffins</a>, or anything else you can think of. Mama also has a worksheet on her computer that allows you to convert any bread recipe into a sourdough recipe.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Suggested Schedule</h2>
    <p>Try following this schedule for a good, healthy starter.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Feed the starter at least once a day, preferably in the morning.</li>
        <li>In the morning, before feeding, separate the starter into 1/2 cup for feeding, and 1/2 cup for proofing. Put the feeder in a jar and the proofer in a mixing bowl. Feed both as usual, then cover and set aside.</li>
        <li>12 hours later (in the evening), use the proofer as recommended in the <a href="sourdough-bread.html">Sourdough Bread</a> recipe. Add the flour, water, and salt and proof over night.</li>
        <li>The next morning, feed your feeder as normal, and place the proofer in the pan for the last rise. If you want, you can use the jarred starter to start proofing another loaf, or batch of something else.</li>
        <li>After 4 hours, bake your proofed bread as stated in the recipe. Using Cook Time and Start Time on the oven is great for this, if you have to go to work.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Using a Backup Starter</h3>
    <p>To feed the backup jar, take it out the night before you plan to feed it, and let it come to room temperature overnight. Do a regular feeding in the morning, and leave it to rise. In the evening, do one more regular feeding, but put it back in the fridge instead of letting it proof.</p>
